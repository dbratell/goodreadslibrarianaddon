Chrome/Opera extension to simplify work for Librarians at Goodreads.

The UI for book editing is at times not optimal and this extension does
various things to make life as a librarian easier.

Born out of a feeling that things should be easier, and a lack of
ability to fix the actual site.

Installation
===
The extension has not yet been uploaded to Chrome Web Store so it can
only be used in development mode.

To use in development mode, turn on "Developer Mode" on your extension page.
Download/clone/checkout all files on your disk. "Load Unpacked" and it
is running. Note that this bypasses all the controls Google does on
extensions so only do this if you trust the code and its developers.
